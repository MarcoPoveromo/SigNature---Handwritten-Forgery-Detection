# [SigNature - Handwritten Forgery Detection](http://MarcoPoveromo.github.io/SigNature---Handwritten-Forgery-Detection/docs/AML___Signature_Verification.pdf)
The goal of the following work is to present and analize the impact of
different approaches to the task of handwritten signature forgery detection.
There will be presented three models related to two kind of approaches:
writer dependent (the model classify a user that already trained on) and
writer independent (the model doesnâ€™t train on new userâ€™s instances), with
advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches, also based on the
number of signatures we have already available for new user.
